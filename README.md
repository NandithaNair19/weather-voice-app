2. Azure Speech Service key

---

## 🌤️ WeatherAPI Setup

1. Visit:
https://www.weatherapi.com/

2. Create account

3. Generate API key

---

## 🎤 Azure Speech Service Setup

1. Open Azure Portal

2. Create:

```

---

# 🛠️ Backend Setup

## Step 1 — Navigate to Backend

```bash
cd backend
```

---

## Step 2 — Create Virtual Environment

Why?

A virtual environment isolates project dependencies from your global Python installation.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

---

## Step 3 — Activate Virtual Environment

### macOS/Linux

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Windows

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## Step 4 — Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Step 5 — Start FastAPI Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Backend runs on:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

# 🎨 Frontend Setup

## Step 1 — Navigate to Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
```

---

## Step 2 — Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Step 3 — Start Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on:

## Frontend

Deployed using **[Vercel](VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md)**

## Backend

Deployed using **[Render](RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md)**

# 🔄 CI/CD Workflow

GitHub Actions automatically:

- installs backend dependencies
- validates FastAPI imports
- installs frontend dependencies
- performs production Vite build

Workflow file:

```text
.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

# CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow checks:

- Backend dependency installation
- FastAPI import validation
- Frontend dependency installation
- Vite production build

---

# Security

- API keys are stored only in backend environment variables
- Frontend never directly exposes WeatherAPI or Azure keys
- Azure Speech token is generated securely through backend routes

---

# Future Improvements

- Weather icons
- Animated backgrounds
- Multilingual speech support
- Voice selection
- Search history
- Favorite cities
- PWA install support
- Android APK generation
- iOS app build
- Better animations and transitions
